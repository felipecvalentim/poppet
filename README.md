###Rebranding

There is no branding or reference to Unifispot  on the Guest UI, only on the Client and Admin interfaces, so you are free to modify the Guest UI under the terms of the AGPL.

However, in some cases, there is a requirement to re-brand the application for commercial reasons, e.g. you are selling Poppet along with other value added extras such as support or carrier services, and one of the conditions of the AGPL is that all copyright, author and AGPL licensing be left intact, and it must also be displayed on any modified version, where ever it was displayed in the original version.

In this instance, a “Permission” can be purchased which will allow you to re-brand the Admin and Client interfaces.For further information, or to purchase a permission to re-brand, please contact us.
